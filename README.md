# Path Planning Project

# Introduction
Path Planning is a vital attribute in many applications of engineering. It can allow us to determine the shortest path (also known as optimal path) between two points, or multiple points if need be. Path planning is used in many industries such as automation industry for autonomous robotics, healthcare industry for surgical equipment, gaming industry for video games, and much more. The purpose of this project is to understand the two most commonly known industry path planning algorithms and create a simple user interface game that will display both algorithms in action. The two algorithms that will be created are the Dijkstras Path Planning Algorithm and the A* Path Planning Algorithm.
